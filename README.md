# HoriSEOn-mainpage

**Horiseon Mainpage**
This is a page for a fictitious digital marketing website named Horiseon. I updated the HTML to a more accessible format so that people with text readers or other similar tools can access this website. I added alt tags to all of the images, and made sure that the page was built from tags such as < aside > or similar instead of and endless slew of <divs>. I also streamlined the CSS as best as I could and removed and redundant code that didn't need to be there. 

**Motivation**
This was my first serious foray into the world of coding. My goal was to understand how to use HTML and CSS better by the end of the project and to apply these newfound skills into something that looks like it could be on the internet.
